# Resource: ultradns_zone

Use this resource to manage zones in UltraDNS

## Example Usage

### Create Primary Zone

```terraform
resource "ultradns_zone" "primary" {
    name        = "example.com."
    account_name = "account"
    type        = "PRIMARY"
    primary_create_info {
        create_type = "NEW"
        restrict_ip{
            single_ip = "192.168.1.1"
        }
        restrict_ip{
            single_ip = "192.168.1.2"
        }
        notify_addresses {
            notify_address = "192.168.1.3"
        }
        notify_addresses {
            notify_address = "192.168.1.4"
        }
        tsig {
            tsig_key_name = "example.com.0.325349282751.key."
